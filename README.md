# Study Goblin 🧠👹

## Why Study Goblin Exists

I built Study Goblin after seeing how stressed my friends were while studying for UC Scout. Everyone was bouncing between different resources—class notes, Google searches, videos, and practice questions—just to prepare for tests.

The idea was to create **one clean website** with *everything you need in one place*:
- Short, clear explanations for quick review  
- Deeper content if you have more time  
- Plenty of practice if that’s how you learn best  

Study Goblin is designed to be **simple**, **easy to navigate**, and genuinely useful whether you’re cramming or doing a full review.
