<summary><strong>Unit 2: Algorithms</strong></summary>

### Computational Thinking
- Breaking large problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- Thinking step-by-step like a computer

### Algorithms
- A clear set of instructions to solve a problem
- Must be ordered, specific, and finite

### Pseudocode
- Writing code logic using plain English
- Helps plan programs without worrying about syntax

### Flowcharting
- Visual diagrams that show the steps of an algorithm
- Use shapes to represent actions and decisions

### What is Abstraction?
- Removing unnecessary details to focus on the main idea
- Makes complex systems easier to understand

<summary><strong>Unit 3: Data</strong></summary>

### Data Overview
- Data is information collected for analysis or decision-making
- Can be numbers, text, images, or sound

### Data Systems
- Tools used to store and manage data
- Examples include databases and spreadsheets

### Data Abstraction
- Simplifying data to highlight important patterns
- Helps manage large data sets

### Digital Data Representation
- All data is stored using binary (0s and 1s)
- Different formats represent different types of data

### Binary Number System
- Base-2 number system using only 0 and 1
- Each digit represents a power of 2

### Binary Search vs Linear Search
- Linear search checks each item one by one
- Binary search repeatedly splits a sorted list (faster)

### Searching & Sorting
- Searching finds data
- Sorting organizes data to make searching faster

### ASCII
- A system that assigns numbers to letters and symbols
- Allows text to be stored digitally

### Data Compression
- Reduces file size
- Can be lossless or lossy

### Data Compression and Storage
- Smaller files save space and transmit faster
- Tradeoffs exist between quality and size

<details>
<summary><strong>Unit 6: Software Development</strong></summary>

### Software Development Cycle
- The process of planning, building, and maintaining software
- Includes design, coding, testing, and updates

### Stages of Development
- Each stage has a specific purpose
- Skipping stages often leads to bugs

### Ethical Issues
- Questions about how technology should be used
- Includes fairness, privacy, and accessibility

### Ethical Use and Responsibility
- Developers are responsible for the impact of their software
- Technology should benefit society

<summary><strong>Unit 10: The Internet</strong></summary>

### The Internet Overview
- A global network of connected computers
- Allows information to be shared worldwide

### History of the Internet
- Started as a research project
- Expanded into a global system

### Internet Systems
- Includes servers, clients, and routers
- Work together to transmit data

### Using HTML to Create a Webpage
- HTML structures content on the web
- Uses tags for text, images, and links

### What is the Internet?
- A network of networks
- Uses protocols to communicate

### Building a Network
- Devices connected to share data
- Can be wired or wireless

### The Need for Addressing
- Devices need unique addresses (IP)
- Ensures data reaches the right location

### Routing & Redundancy
- Routing determines data paths
- Redundancy prevents system failure

### Packets
- Data is split into small pieces
- Reassembled at the destination

### HTTPS & DNS
- HTTPS secures web communication
- DNS converts domain names to IPs

### Fault Tolerance
- Systems continue working despite failures
- Important for reliability

### Parallel and Distributed Computing
- Parallel: tasks run at the same time
- Distributed: tasks spread across computers
