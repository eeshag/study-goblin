# Study Goblin — Home Page Design

## Purpose

The home page is designed to be the **fastest possible entry point** into studying for UC Scout courses.  
There should be no friction, no clutter, and no unnecessary decisions.

The user should immediately:
1. Understand what Study Goblin is
2. Pick their course
3. Start studying

## Default Theme

- **Dark mode enabled by default**
- Minimal color palette
- High contrast for readability
- No animations that distract from content

---

## Top Navigation

### Elements

- **Study Goblin** (logo or text, left-aligned)
- **Theme Toggle** (right-aligned)
  - 🌙 Dark mode (default)
  - ☀️ Light mode (optional)

### Behavior

- Theme toggle is always visible
- Switching themes does not reload the page
- Theme preference is remembered locally (browser-based)

---

## Hero Section

### Main Heading

> **Welcome to Study Goblin**

Large, centered, and immediately visible.

### Subheading (Optional but Recommended)

> A simple, fast way to review for UC Scout courses.

This should be subtle and not overpower the main heading.

## Course Selection Section

### Description

Below the welcome message, users should see a list/grid of available AP courses.  
This is the **primary call to action** on the page.

### Layout

- Centered grid or vertical list
- Large clickable cards or buttons
- Plenty of spacing to avoid visual clutter

### Initial Courses

- **AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP)**

### Future Courses (Placeholder)

- Coming Soon:
  - AP Calculus
  - AP Biology
  - AP Chemistry
  - AP Statistics

(These should appear disabled or visually muted.)

---

## Course Card Behavior

Each course card should:
- Be clickable
- Immediately route the user into the course content
- Have no intermediate confirmation screens

Example card content:
- Course name
- Short descriptor (optional)
  - “Notes, practice questions, and finals review”

---

## Design Principles

- No ads
- No login prompts
- No pop-ups
- No gamification
- No distractions

Everything on this page exists to answer one question:
> “What do you want to study right now?”

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Required for MVP)

- Search bar for courses
- Recently visited course shortcut
- Keyboard navigation support
- Accessibility improvements (screen reader labels, focus states)

---

## Notes

This page should load instantly and work well on:
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Phones

Performance and clarity matter more than visual complexity.
